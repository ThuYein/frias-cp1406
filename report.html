  <li>PMI  - your group should spend some time reflecting on the process and describe here  the Pluses, Minuses and Interesting aspects of your teamwork process and result </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>PLUSES:</strong><br />
  We  are able to divide the work easily so each individual has their own parts to  fasten the process on the on-going website. We held regular meetings to complete  the website and we had full attendees throughout the set meetings. Meetings has  lead us to more understanding of what we have to do to make our website greater. </p>
<p><strong>MINUSES:</strong><br />
  What  slows us down is the procrastination on some areas of the website where we stop  and do other things first. We had trouble with GitHub where we couldn't commit at some point and had to reclone the folder. </p>
<p><strong>APECTS:</strong><br />
  We  try not to waste as much time as possible so one effective way we did was to  enable the exchanging of individual parts. This allows us to exchange the parts  to someone else whenever the person are unable to do. </p>
<p><strong>RESULT:</strong><br />
  In  the end we are able to compile all the individual parts together and made a  professional website. It has become more compatible and very attractive to the  eye. We have learned many about Dreamweaver and GitHub where we have developted set of skills in both programs. </p>
